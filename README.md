# WIP B+ Tree Visualization
##### Helping you understand the data structure and its algorithms.

</div>

## ⇁ The Problems
1. You're taking databases 101. You find yourself struggling to understand the edge cases of 
the B+ tree algorithms. So you turn to visualizations for help. Visualization such as the ones linked below.

2. The visualizations you find are cumbersome. You can't move through the algorithms
at the exact pace that you need. You also can't easily share examples with your classmates or professor.
3. You want to be able to move forward and backwards through the algorithms at whatever speed you want and
share B+ tree examples as easily as you share text over the internet.

## ⇁ The Solutions
1. An animated interactive B+ tree visualization with a smooth timeline control.
2. The ability to use plain text coma delimited lists of numbers as an input value.

## ⇁ The Demo
This project is still WIP so all I can offer now is some videos of the current build.
